## To Do
- only show the top card in each "pokemon" stack by default. clicking the top card will reveal all the other cards in the stack

## Done
- flip a coin
- put out 6 prize cards
- track damage and special conditions
- render bench cards upon game load
- flip bench and active pokemon before the game starts
- do a great ball (look at top 7 cards, pick one, shuffle the other cards back into deck)
