# Kanban

## To Do
- collapse "pokemon" containers by default
- drag and drop cards!
- when a pokemon becomes asleep, paralyzed, or burned - deactivate the other 2
- automatically load decks if they have already been chosen
- return discarded cards back to hand or deck (hand 2?)

## Doing
- only show the top card in each "pokemon" stack by default. clicking the top card will reveal all the other cards in the stack

## Done
- flip a coin
- put out 6 prize cards
- track damage and special conditions
- render bench cards upon game load
- flip bench and active pokemon before the game starts
- do a great ball (look at top 7 cards, pick one, shuffle the other cards back into deck)
- figure out how to invoke a modal without a button click
- switch pokemon between active and bench
- draw a specific card from the deck into our hand
- see the number cards in opponent's hand
- retrieve prize cards
- discard energy (or other cards) from a pokemon
